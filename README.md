# A list of half-baked projects and ideas

## Ideas

* Compact bookshelf - an embryonic business idea: generate a poster based on Goodreads data to replace your paper bookshelf (inspired by Robert Miles talking on Spencer Greenberg's podcast). Possible extensions include grouping by author, cover images of each book, dots by each book to show whether you've read it or not, grouping by type e.g. fiction, non-fiction, cookery.

* Safer cycling route - enter where you cycle from and to, and use [TFL accident data](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/safety-and-security/road-safety/london-collision-map) to spot where accidents have happened in the past, so you can look out for them in future.

## A few unfinished bits of data science:

* Pubs - a few charts on the number of pubs in UK by size
* Alcohol health stats - no work yet, looking at the impact of alcohol consumption on health
